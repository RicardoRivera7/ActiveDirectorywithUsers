This is used to build a working active directory which we will then add users utilzing powershell and a script
<br />

<h2>Windows Server Setup</h2>
Click the download link and download the Windows 10 ISO and Windows Server ISO <br/> 
Lets start by creating the Windows Server which will be our Domain Controller, in Virtualbox complete the following: <br/>
1. Click New to create new machine <br/>
2. Name the machine something along the lines of DomainController or DC <br/>
3. Select ISO image and set version to "Other Windows(64-bit)" <br/>
4. Check the box that says "Skip unattended installation" <br/>
5. Set the memory size to at least 2gb (2048mb) <br/>
6. Click "Finish" <br/>

Go to the network tab <br/>
For adpater 1 select "attached to:" and choose NAT <br/>

<br />
<br />
Start the machine to begin the installation <br/>
Once a window pops up click next and then "Install Now" <br/>
Select the "Windows Server 2019 Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience)" <br/>

Now to unlock the machine requires a special input that virtual machines dont allow <br/>
So on the top of the machine click on "Input" and then click Keyboard and select "Insert Ctrl+Alt+Del" <br/>
Enter the password you made earlier <br/>

<h2>Optional: Guest additions installation</h2>
This section is to install guesst additions which will help to scale your vm window size and help it run smoother but you can skip this <br/>
<br/>
On the top of your machine click on "devices" and select "Insert guest additions CD image"
Go to File explorer (Click the folder icon on the bottom) 
Click on "This PC" and select virtual box guest additions

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/taOh4Rd.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Firewall Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
You should now be logged in as one of the users you created! <br/>
You can do this with any of the users you made give it a try! <br/>
<br />
<br />


<h2>Fun Extras!</h2>
As some added fun you can go back to your domain controller and if you go to the DHCP section like we had before and go to -> IPv4 -> Adress Leases then you can see your client machine with its lease!
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8A4KQ9q.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Firewall Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
If you also go back to the "Active Directory Users and Computers" section and click on the "Computers" folder then you can see your client machine as part of the domain!
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/H3BlBEi.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Firewall Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
If you go back to the user you're logged in with on your client machine, go to the command terminal and type in "whoami" then you can see the user name along with the domain!
